# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a new project called "claudes-first-project" that appears to be in the initial setup phase. The project is located within a testing environment for CLI tools.

## Current Project State

The project is currently empty with no defined tech stack, build system, or source code. The only existing configuration is the Claude CLI settings that restrict bash commands to `ls` operations only.

## Development Setup

Since this is a new project, the tech stack and development tools have not yet been determined. When setting up the project:

1. Consider the intended purpose and choose an appropriate tech stack
2. Initialize the project with the chosen package manager (npm, pip, go mod, cargo, etc.)
3. Set up linting, formatting, and testing tools appropriate to the chosen language
4. Update this file with the specific commands once they are established

## Security Configuration

The project has Claude CLI permissions configured in `.claude/settings.local.json` that currently only allow `ls` bash commands. This can be updated as needed when development requirements become clearer.

## Next Steps

When developing this project:
1. Define the project's purpose and requirements
2. Choose and initialize the appropriate tech stack
3. Set up version control if needed (the directory is not currently a git repository)
4. Create initial project structure and configuration files
5. Update this CLAUDE.md file with specific development commands and architecture details
