# Learning MCP (Model Context Protocol) Plan

## Overview

Based on our research, MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that enables LLMs to access external tools and data sources. This plan will guide you through learning MCP integration with Claude Code, focusing on practical implementation for your financial applications and Golang development work.

## What We Know About MCP

### Core Concepts
- **Purpose**: Enables Claude to access external tools and data sources
- **Protocol Types**: Stdio, SSE (Server-Sent Events), HTTP servers
- **Scopes**: Local (project-specific), Project (team shared), User (cross-project)
- **Security**: Third-party servers require trust verification

### MCP Integration with Claude Code
- **Setup Command**: `claude mcp add my-server -e API_KEY=123 -- /path/to/server arg1 arg2`
- **Usage Examples**: Database queries, resource references, slash commands
- **Resource References**: `@github:issue://123`, `@docs:file://api/authentication`
- **Slash Commands**: `/mcp__github__list_prs`, `/mcp__jira__create_issue`

### Key Features
- Dynamic resource discovery
- OAuth 2.0 authentication support
- Cross-platform server integration
- Custom tool development capability
