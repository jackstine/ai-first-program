# MCP Learning Plan for Beginners

Based on your answers, here's a focused plan to learn MCP from complete beginner to comfortable user.

## What You Need to Understand First

### What is MCP?
MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a way to give Claude Code access to external tools and data that it normally can't reach. Think of it as building bridges between Claude and other systems.

### What Does "Data Access" Mean?
- **Reading files** from systems Claude can't normally access
- **Querying databases** to get information
- **Calling APIs** to fetch data from web services
- **Accessing local tools** like git repositories, development environments

### What Does "Development Workflow Automation" Mean?
- **Automating repetitive tasks** like code generation, testing, deployment
- **Integrating tools** so Claude can control them directly
- **Creating custom commands** that Claude can execute
- **Building workflows** that chain multiple operations together

### MCP Server Types (Simplified)
1. **Stdio**: Simple programs that communicate through standard input/output (easiest to start with)
2. **HTTP**: Web-based servers that communicate through web requests (like APIs)
3. **SSE**: Real-time streaming servers for live data updates

## Your Learning Project: "Developer Assistant MCP"

We'll build one comprehensive project that grows more powerful as you learn. This will be a personal developer assistant that starts simple and evolves.

### Project Evolution:
1. **Week 1**: Understand MCP + Set up existing MCP server
2. **Week 2**: Use MCP to access local files and git information  
3. **Week 3**: Add code analysis and simple automation
4. **Week 4**: Create custom tools for your development workflow

- Design next learning objectives

## Success Metrics

You'll know you've successfully learned MCP when you can:

1. **Explain MCP** to someone else in simple terms
2. **Set up existing MCP servers** and connect them to Claude Code
3. **Use MCP slash commands** confidently in Claude Code
4. **Build a simple custom MCP server** that solves a real problem
5. **Integrate MCP tools** into your daily development workflow
6. **Troubleshoot MCP issues** and find solutions independently

## Key Concepts You'll Master

### Technical Concepts
- **MCP Protocol**: How Claude communicates with external tools
