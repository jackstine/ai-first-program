### Step 8: Create Hands-On Exercises
1. **Exercise 1**: Set up first MCP server
2. **Exercise 2**: Connect to financial data source
3. **Exercise 3**: Build Go code generation tool
4. **Exercise 4**: Create custom slash commands
5. **Exercise 5**: Implement OAuth 2.0 authentication
6. **Exercise 6**: Deploy to production environment

### Step 9: Develop Reference Materials
1. **Create MCP command reference** for financial applications
2. **Build troubleshooting guide** with common issues and solutions
3. **Design quick-start templates** for common MCP patterns
4. **Write security checklist** for financial MCP applications
5. **Create deployment guide** with best practices

## Phase 4: Tutorial Integration and Testing

### Step 10: Update Project Files
1. **Update todo.md** with specific MCP learning tasks and milestones
2. **Add MCP section to CLAUDE.md** with project-specific guidance
3. **Create mcp-examples/** directory with code samples
4. **Update research.md** with MCP learning insights
5. **Add MCP resources to claude-code-links.md**

### Step 11: Create Tutorial Structure
1. **Create tutorial-mcp/** directory structure:
   ```
   tutorial-mcp/
   ├── 01-fundamentals/
   ├── 02-financial-integration/
   ├── 03-go-development-tools/
   ├── 04-production-deployment/
   ├── examples/
   ├── reference/
   └── troubleshooting/
   ```
2. **Write main tutorial index** with learning path navigation
3. **Create progress tracking** for tutorial completion
4. **Add code templates** for common MCP patterns

### Step 12: Quality Assurance
1. **Review tutorial content** for technical accuracy
2. **Test all code examples** and exercises
3. **Verify security recommendations** for financial applications
4. **Check tutorial progression** and learning curve
5. **Create tutorial completion checklist**

## Phase 5: Ongoing Maintenance and Enhancement

### Step 13: Documentation and Support
1. **Create FAQ section** based on common questions
2. **Write troubleshooting guide** with solutions to common issues
3. **Document best practices** discovered during tutorial development
