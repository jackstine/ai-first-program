## Answered Questions

1. What types of projects do you primarily work on? What programming languages do you use most frequently? Are you working on personal projects, professional/work projects, or both?
   - (A) I work on projects associated with financial applications and development ETO processes. I use Golang most frequently, but sometimes I do write Python and whenever I'm writing on the web it has to be JavaScript and HTML. I am inclined to learning TypeScript. Yes, I'm working on personal projects and professional projects.

2. What's your current development setup? What are the most time-consuming or repetitive tasks in your current workflow? What aspects of coding do you find most challenging or tedious?
   - (A) For this project, we don't have any right now. We have no development workflow. I find that writing schemas, refactoring, finding information in my code are very tedious. As far as challenging, I like challenging I love challenging. I love to revel in it.

3. What specific Claude Code features are you most interested in? Are you looking to use Claude Code for specific tasks?
   - (A) I don't know what Claude can do for me so right now I'm just trying to learn. I want Claude Code to do everything for me if they can do that I want to learn how to use Claude Code. I want to revel in learning how to use it I want to understand complexities of Claude Code the simplicities, the intricate details the understanding of why it's working why it isn't working the way I expected to.

4. Do you prefer to learn by following structured tutorials, experimenting with real projects, reading documentation thoroughly first, or jumping in and learning as you go?
   - (A) I would prefer to learn by following tutorials and reading documentation.

5. Are you interested in integrating Claude Code with GitHub Actions, CI/CD pipelines, IDE extensions, or custom scripts? Do you work in a team environment where you'd want to share Claude Code workflows?
   - (A) At this time, I'm not interested in integration and automation.

6. Can you describe 2-3 specific scenarios where you think Claude Code could help you most? Are there any particular pain points in your development process you're hoping Claude Code can address?
   - (A) I think Claude Code could help me write a lot code. It can help me do research. It can also help me dive deep into alternative options or things that I've never thought of. Also, it can be an aid and ask me questions.

7. How will you know when you've successfully learned to use Claude Code effectively? What would make Claude Code a valuable tool in your development toolkit?
   - (A) I will know when I know.

8. Are there any concerns you have about using AI-assisted coding tools? Are there specific tasks you would NOT want to use Claude Code for? Do you have any security or privacy requirements we should consider?
   - (A) I really don't have any security requirements, but there are some things I do consider but for now we can just wait. We don't have to concern with those security concerns that I have.

9. Have you used other AI coding assistants? If yes, what did you like/dislike about them? What would you want Claude Code to do differently or better?
   - (A) Yes, I have used some other AI coding assistants, but not to a great depth.
