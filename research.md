## MCP Learning Profile (Updated)

### Learning Approach for MCP
- **Starting Point**: Complete beginner with MCP - needs foundational understanding
- **Focus**: Single comprehensive project rather than multiple small examples
- **Timeline**: 40 hours available for learning (highly dedicated)
- **Preference**: Real projects over structured exercises
- **Approach**: Start with existing MCP servers rather than building from scratch

### Current Knowledge Gaps
- **Fundamental concepts**: Doesn't understand data access, workflow automation, or server types
- **MCP server types**: Unfamiliar with Stdio, SSE, HTTP distinctions
- **Real-time streaming**: Interested but doesn't understand SSE servers
- **Practical applications**: Needs examples of what MCP can do for development

### Learning Priorities
1. **Foundation First**: Explain what MCP is and core concepts
2. **Hands-on Learning**: Use existing MCP servers to understand capabilities
3. **Simple Project**: Start with basic implementation, avoid complexity
4. **Practical Understanding**: Focus on "what can MCP do for me" rather than theory
5. **Comfort Building**: Success measured by understanding and comfort level

### Project Requirements
- **Scope**: One comprehensive project to focus learning
- **Complexity**: Start simple, build complexity gradually
- **Personal Use**: No team collaboration requirements
- **Security**: No compliance or security constraints
- **Integration**: No existing tools to integrate initially

### Recommended MCP Learning Path
1. **Week 1**: MCP fundamentals and concept explanation
2. **Week 2**: Set up and explore existing MCP servers
3. **Week 3**: Build simple custom MCP integration
4. **Week 4**: Expand project with real-world applications
5. **Ongoing**: Apply MCP knowledge to Golang development
