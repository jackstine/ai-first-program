# Tic-Tac-Toe Bubble Tea Project Plan

## Project Overview
Create a terminal-based tic-tac-toe game using Go and the Bubble Tea framework for learning purposes.

## Key Requirements
1. Two-player tic-tac-toe game (X and O)
2. Terminal user interface using Bubble Tea
3. Keyboard navigation for moves
4. Win detection and game state management
5. Clean, intuitive interface

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
1. **Game State** - Track board, current player, game status
2. **Game Logic** - Move validation, win checking, turn management
3. **UI Model** - Bubble Tea model for rendering and updates
4. **Input Handling** - Keyboard controls for player moves

### Data Structures
```go
type GameState struct {
    Board        [3][3]string  // Game board
    CurrentPlayer string       // "X" or "O"
    Status       string        // "playing", "won", "draw"
    Winner       string        // Winner if game is won
}

type Model struct {
    Game         GameState
    CursorX      int          // Current cursor position
    CursorY      int
}
```

### Game Rules
- 3x3 grid
- Players alternate turns (X starts first)
- Win conditions: 3 in a row (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Draw condition: board full with no winner

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Setup
- Initialize Go module
- Set up basic project structure
- Create main.go with entry point

### Phase 2: Core Game Logic
- Implement game state structure
- Add move validation
- Create win condition checking
- Add turn management

### Phase 3: Bubble Tea Integration
- Set up Bubble Tea framework
- Create basic model and view
- Implement update logic
- Add keyboard input handling

### Phase 4: UI Polish
- Improve board display
- Add status messages
- Create win/draw screens
- Polish user experience

## Controls Design
- Arrow keys: Move cursor
- Enter/Space: Place mark
- 'r': Reset game
- 'q': Quit game

## Display Layout
```
   1   2   3
1     |   | X
  -----------
2  O  | X |  
  -----------
3     |   |  

Player X's turn
Use arrow keys to move, Enter to place
```

## Technical Dependencies
- Go 1.21+
- Bubble Tea framework (github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- Lipgloss for styling (github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)

## Learning Objectives
1. Understand Bubble Tea's Model-Update-View pattern
2. Practice Go struct design and methods
3. Implement game logic and state management
4. Create interactive terminal applications
5. Handle keyboard input in Go applications

## Success Criteria
- Game runs without errors
- All win conditions work correctly
- Intuitive user controls
- Clean, readable code structure
- Proper error handling
